In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.","category":"Software Engineering","title":"Natural Language Processing"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/software-engineering/","slug":"/learn/reinforcement-learning/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"From the perspective of data analysis, streaming data is the big data coming continuously from various sources such as nature, human, and machines, that we can process in real-time. The temperature of an environment, financial transactions, and state of a running program are examples of streaming data.","category":"Software Engineering","title":"Reinforcement Learning"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"Software Engineering","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":100,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/category/software-engineering","nextPagePath":"//category/software-engineering/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
