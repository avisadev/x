In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/creative-intelligence/","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creative Intelligence","date":"2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","category":"Data Science","description":"Creativity may be the ultimate moonshot for artificial intelligence.
