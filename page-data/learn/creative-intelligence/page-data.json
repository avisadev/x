In fact, the reality is that today’s AI is largely dependent on human\nintelligence to function. To ensure the success of your industrial AI projects,\nit’s critical to incorporate the knowledge of your employees and other humans\nin designing and training the systems, establishing best practices, and, once\ndeployed, in managing, overseeing and correcting them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/rug.jpg\" alt=\"Nulla faucibus vestibulum eros in tempus. Vestibulum tempor imperdiet velit nec dapibus\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Persian rugs are a testament to the ability and creativity of the artisans who craft them. The skills used in weaving these rugs have been passed from generation to generation. Just as each weaver is different, each handmade carpet is unique – no two are identical. <sup>(2)</sup> Photo: <a href=\"http://zollanvari.com/\" target=\"blank\">zollanvari.com</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Silicon Valley won’t tell you this, but some of the most successful AI systems in\nproduction are hybrid AI systems. Hybrid AI seeks not to replace human labor,\nbut to eliminate the most boring and repetitive aspects of it, allowing humans\nto spend more time on complex requests. Even looking to the future, a realistic\nscenario for many AI systems still anticipates significant human involvement,\nwith humans handling perhaps the most complex 10% of requests.</p>\n<p>Today there is a delusion that we can solve all the problems with AI. There is a big problem with this idea. Instead of supporting AI progress, it jeopardizes the value of machine intelligence by disregarding important AI safety principles and setting unrealistic expectations about what AI can do for humanity. <sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"/creative2.jpg\" alt=\"Nulla faucibus vestibulum eros in tempus. Vestibulum tempor imperdiet velit nec dapibus\"></p>\n<p>Creativity may be the ultimate moonshot for artificial intelligence. Already AI has helped write pop ballads, mimicked the styles of great painters and informed creative decisions in filmmaking. Experts wonder, however, how far AI can or should go in the creative process? <sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<p>Technology moves fast forward, but “the essence of Life is creative intelligence. Out of creativity comes resilience—the ability to envision and find a new path. Creative intelligence is a quality that physicists increasingly believe is inherent in the universe. Inherent in Life. And thus inherent in us. This is what we need to solve today’s problems in a way that works for all Life.” <sup>(5)</sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The quest for AI creativity [Internet].
